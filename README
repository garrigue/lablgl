		LablGL 0.96-beta: Installation and Use instructions

1. Description

  LablGL is an OpenGL interface for Objective Caml. Since it includes
support for the Togl widget, you can comfortably use it with LablTk.

2. Requisites

  * Objective Caml 3.03-alpha
  * LablTk (included in Objective Caml, requires Tcl/Tk)
  * OpenGL version 1.0 or 1.1

  Objective Caml can be obtained from
	http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/

  OpenGL (with hardware support) is already on your machine on SGI and
most DEC Alpha systems. It may also be the case with Solaris machines,
and if you do not have it you may obtain it from Sun.
  If you are not lucky enough to have OpenGL support, you can still
use Mesa, an openGL-compatible freeware, which works on almost
everything.

  LablGl also uses the Togl widget, but the code is already included
in this distribution (version 1.5). You may obtain more information
about Togl at:
	http://www.mesa3d.org/brianp/Togl.html

3. Installation

  a) Edit Makefile.config

  b) Build LablGL
	% make

  c) For the native code version (you need the native code version of LablTk),
	% make opt

  d) Install LablGL
	% make install

4. Use

  * The lablgl toplevel
    This is a toplevel, like ocaml, including LablTk, Unix, Str and LablGL.
    You may use it either as a toplevel, or directly to run scripts.
    To run an example, type:
        % lablgl -labels example.ml
    where example.ml is one of: (by order of complexity)
 	simple.ml
	scene.ml
	checker.ml	
	double.ml
	planet.ml
	texturesurf.ml
	gears.ml
	morph3d.ml
	tennis.ml

  * compiling and linking
    You need to include labltk.cma, lablgl.cma and togl.cmo in your link:
        ocamlc -I CAMLLIB/labltk -I CAMLLIB/lablGL \
            labltk.cma lablgl.cma togl.cmo ... -o program

5. Writing programs

  All of the GL and GLU libraries are available. Read a good book
  about how to use these. Translating from OpenGL to LablGL is rather
  straitforward: there is a LablGL function for each OpenGL one.  For
  ease of retrieving, bot GL and GLU are cut in smaller modules of
  related functions.  See in appendix A which modules your function is
  in. By default it has the same name, gl or glu omited, and capitals
  replaced by underscores.  When arguments are labelled, the name is
  taken from the man page or the C prototype.

  OpenGL makes heavy using of enumerations, with names staring with
  GL_ or GLU_ . Since their meaning is often overloaded, they are all
  converted to polymorphic variants. In most cases just replace prefix
  by a backquote and convert to low case. When you have a doubt the
  best way is to have a look with LablBrowser.

  Using Togl is also straightforward. Everything works like in
  LablTk. You create an openGL widget with Togl.create, and then you
  apply various functions on it. See Togl's README for details.

6. Comments and bug reports

   mailto:garrigue@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp

   This library has been tested on a number of programs, but this is
   far from testing all of OpenGL functionality. There are bugs, but
   at least we didn't find any in our examples.
