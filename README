		LablGL 1.00: Installation and Use instructions

1. Description

  LablGL is an OpenGL interface for Objective Caml. It includes two
interfaces: the Togl widget, for comfortable use with LablTk, and
LablGlut for standalone applications not using Tcl/Tk

2. Requisites

  * Objective Caml 3.05, 3.06 or 3.07
  * LablTk (included in Objective Caml, requires Tcl/Tk) for Togl support
  * OpenGL
  * glut (included in Mesa) for glut support
  * GNU make (for conditionals)

  Objective Caml can be obtained from
	http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/

  OpenGL (with hardware support) is already on your machine on SGI and
most DEC Alpha systems. It may also be the case with Solaris machines,
and if you do not have it you may obtain it from Sun.
  XFree86 supports the GLX protocol since version 4.0, with hardware
acceleration on some platforms. It is available on most recent Linux
configurations.
  If you are not lucky enough to have built-in OpenGL support, you can
still use Mesa, an openGL-compatible freeware, which works on almost
everything.
	http://www.mesa3d.org/

  LablGl also uses the Togl widget, but the code is already included
in this distribution (version 1.5). You may obtain more information
about Togl at:
	http://www.mesa3d.org/brianp/Togl.html
Note that Togl is only compatible with vanilla Tcl/Tk: specially
patched versions may not work. For instance 8.2.3+ included in old
debian distributions does not work.

3. Installation

Precompiled versions of lablGL are available for windows, and a number
of Linux distributions. In this case you just have to install
necessary packages. Otherwise, compile from source.

  a) Edit Makefile.config
     Some tested configurations are provided.

  b) Build LablGL with both Togl(Tcl/Tk) and Glut support.
	% make

     If you need only Togl support, do
        % make togl
     If you need only Glut support, do
        % make glut
     If you need neither (use the library with lablGtk for instance)
        % make lib


  c) For the native code version (you need the native code version of LablTk),
	% make opt

     Similarly, you can also do
        % make {toglopt,glutopt,libopt}

  d) Install LablGL
	% make install

     This will install all the available parts.   


With the windows binary distribution, copy bin\lablgl.bat,
lib\stublibs\*.dll and lib\lablGL to their respective subdirectories
in the OCaml distribution. 

To compile for Windows, just remember to add the include and lib directories to
the corresponding environment variables, or the appropriate switches in the 
makefile. Also, uncomment the necessary lines in the Makefile.config file. 

4. Use

  Examples are in the Togl/examples and LablGlut/examples directories.

  * The lablgl toplevel
    This is a toplevel, like ocaml, including LablTk, Unix, Str, LablGL
    and Togl.
    You may use it either as a toplevel, or directly to run scripts.
    To run an example in Togl/examples, type:
        % lablgl example.ml
    where example.ml is one of: (by order of complexity)
 	simple.ml
	scene.ml
	checker.ml	
	double.ml
	planet.ml
	texturesurf.ml
	gears.ml
	morph3d.ml
	tennis.ml

   Note that some XFree86 do not seem to support single buffer
   rendering. The first 3 examples will not work in that case.

  * Similarely, there is a lablglut toplevel.
    For instance, move to the folder LablGlut/examples/lablGL and type

	% lablglut gears.ml

  * compiling and linking
    You need to include either labltk.cma, lablgl.cma and togl.cma or'
    lablgl.cma and lablglut.cma in your link:
        ocamlc -I +labltk -I +lablGL \
            labltk.cma lablgl.cma togl.cma ... -o program
        ocamlc -I +lablGL lablgl.cma lablglut.cma ... -o program

5. Writing programs

  All of the GL and GLU libraries are available. Read a good book
  about how to use these. Translating from OpenGL to LablGL is rather
  straightforward: there is a LablGL function for each OpenGL one.
  For ease of retrieving, both GL and GLU are cut in smaller modules
  of related functions.  See in appendix A which modules your function
  is in. By default it has the same name, gl or glu omited, and
  capitals replaced by underscores.  When arguments are labelled, the
  names are taken from the man page or the C prototype.

  OpenGL makes heavy use of enumerations, with names starting with
  GL_ or GLU_ . Since their meaning is often overloaded, they are all
  converted to polymorphic variants. In most cases just replace prefix
  by a backquote and convert to low case. When you have a doubt the
  best way is to have a look with OCamlBrowser.

  Using Togl is also straightforward. Everything works like in
  LablTk. You create an openGL widget with Togl.create, and then you
  apply various functions on it. See Togl's README in Togl/src/Togl/README
  for details.

  To use LablGlut you need to look at glut's documentation on your system.
  The approach is close to LablGL's.

6. Comments and bug reports

   mailto:garrigue@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp

   This library has been tested on a number of programs, but this is
   far from testing all of OpenGL functionality. There are bugs, but
   at least we didn't find any in our examples.
